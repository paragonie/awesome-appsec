A curated list of resources for learning about application security. Contains books,
websites, blog posts, and self-assessment quizzes.

Maintained by [Paragon Initiative Enterprises](https://paragonie.com) with
contributions from the application security and developer communities. We also
have [other community projects](https://paragonie.com/projects) which might be
useful for tomorrow's application security experts.

If you are an absolute beginner to the topic of software security, you may benefit
from reading [A Gentle Introduction to Application Security](https://paragonie.com/blog/2015/08/gentle-introduction-application-security).

### [Why Invest in Application Security?](https://paragonie.com/white-paper/2015-why-invest-application-security) (2015)

**Released**: June 21, 2015

Running a business requires being cost-conscious and minimizing unnecessary spending. The benefits of ensuring in the security of your application are invisible to most companies, so often times they neglect to invest in secure software development as a cost-saving measure. What these companies don't realize is the potential cost (both financial and to brand reputation) a preventable data compromise can incur.

**The average data breach costs millions of dollars in damage.**

Investing more time and personnel to develop secure software is, for most companies, worth it to minimize this unnecessary risk to their bottom line.
